Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) is a tool independent standard for the Model Exchange (ME) and for Co-Simulation (CS) between different tools in a standardized format. In the FMI nomenclature, a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) model implements one or two of FMIs. Compared to Simulink(MATLAB, Mathworks) that is designed to model dynamic systems, FMU has the advantage of supporting more data types and language features. FMI also addresses the disadvantage of the Simulink S-function as it is easier to integrate with other simulators and takes less memory overhead. 

In model exchange, FMU does not come with its numerical solver. FMU only provides functions to set the states and inputs and compute the state derivatives. It requires
the solver in the host environment/import tool to query the derivatives and update the states of the FMU. In co-simulation, a specialized numerical solver is embedded in the FMU. The host environment only sets the inputs and time steps, and reads the outputs. Since encrypted control usually requires a complex model, the authors adopted the co-simulation option. FMU can be run with FMPy, a free Python library, to execute FMUs that support Co-Simulation and Model Exchange and run on Windows and Linux.
