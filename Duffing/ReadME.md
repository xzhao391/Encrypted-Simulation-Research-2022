The duffing equation can model a mass suspended on a parallel combination of a damper with linear damping and a spring with nonlinear restoring force, excited by a harmonic force. The restoring force provided by the nonlinear spring is then $\alpha x + \beta x^{3}$.

The proposed approach will encrypt the entire dynamic including: the nonlinear spring force, linear damping force, mass position, velocity, and acceleration.
