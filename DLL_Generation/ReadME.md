This section introduces the implementation of Dyer's SHE to control/autonomus system using C++ and shows how to generate .dll from Cmake. 

__declspec(dllexport) at the beginning of the funtion is used to export the function from a DLL. [&] at the beginning of each sub_function to allow acecess from each other. Negative or Positive value of a number is encrypted separatedly since there isn't an easy way to change the sign of the cipher text. Due to quantization, each ciphertext should have the same depth(previous times of multiplication) to perform correctly. To return the values, the decrypted values are put into an array.
